# SuperU UI Recreation (Frontend)

This project is a **UI recreation of selected sections from https://www.superu.ai/**, built to demonstrate attention to detail, layout precision, and responsive frontend implementation.

##  What’s Recreated

I have recreated the following two sections from the SuperU website:

1. **How It Works Section**
   - Step-based flow layout
   - Interactive cards
   - Responsive behavior across screen sizes
   - Clean spacing and visual hierarchy

2. **Pricing Comparison Section**
   - Full feature comparison matrix
   - Sticky table header
   - Scrollable content container
   - Mobile-friendly layout with no horizontal scrolling

These components were rebuilt from scratch with a focus on **UI fidelity**, **responsiveness**, and **clean component structure**.
